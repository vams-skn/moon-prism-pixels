# **Moon Prism Pixels**

***In the name of the Moon, I bring you retro vibes! âœ¨***

Remember the days of 90s fansites? The chaos, colors, GIFs, and blinking texts? Inspired by them, this project celebrates the magic of the *Sailor Moon* characters by capturing them in 90s web design.

Welcome to **Moon Prism Pixels**, a nostalgic fansite dedicated to the beloved *Sailor Moon* and her fellow Sailor Guardians!

This project was created for the CodÃ©dex Mini Holiday Hackathon, Track 2: Now Itâ€™s Personal.

Whether youâ€™re a Moonie veteran or new to the world of Sailor Moon, this fansite promises a magical experience!  

## The 90s Web Design 
To bring the 90s fansite aesthetic to life, I have:  
- Included starry moving backgrounds to all the pages and formatted the main content to take only half the available space.
- Added music to the site that can be played or paused by clicking on the music note icon.
- Designed everything the 90s way! Tables, iframes, center tags, marquees and more.
- Pixel GIFs galore!  
- Custom cursor and cursor effects.
- Typewriter fonts, blinking text, and marquees that scream nostalgia.
